## Stephen Dodd Games

Welcome to Stephen Dodd Games, this repository houses all the code related to the game development tutorials at <a href="https://stephendoddtech.com/category/game-design">Stephen Dodd Tech Game Design</a>.

The example projects can be found at <a href="https://stevesdodd.github.io/sd-games/">sd-games</a>.

## Running the projects

Each of the projects are in a separate directory. They all follow the same setup. To run a particular project locally change to the given project's directory and run the following commands.

`npm install`: Installs the required projects dependencies.

`npm run build`: Compiles the project to the `build` directory

`npm run serve`: Starts a local file server pointed to the `build` directory.

Open a browser and head to `localhost:8080` to see the current project.

Most of the projects have cold reloading which means if you make a change to the code locally, save and refresh the browser you should see your changes reflected in the browser.
